<div><h1>Welcome<i> </i>to<i> </i>the<i> </i>Floor<i> </i>of<i> </i>Yore!</h1></div>
<p>This is an (admittedly somewhat intentionally random) interactive \ experience based around the Days of Yore album cover art, meant to be explored at your own pace. Hopefully, what you should do next at any given point will be apparent (if not always exactly obvious), but if you find yourself stuck, some helpful hints: | Keep an eye on your cursor / mouse pointer. Hovering over any element should let you know whether you can (or can't) click or need to wait to be able to interact further, or provide some other clue as to the element's function. (Also, beware: cursors may behave unreliably if Adobe Photoshop is left open while using the site.) | Traffic signals may flash in the top right corner. A red hand means much the same thing it does in real life: you'll need to wait before proceeding. Meanwhile, enjoy the view. | Occasionally, a cluster of bright arrows will briefly appear immediately after you click on something: these indicate where you need to focus your attention next. | If you're still at a loss, look for the elements that most recently appeared, or that used to be static and are now animated. That usually means they are waiting for your click. Items that can accept multiple clicks will continue to show a pointer cursor or else show a cursor with a plus sign.</p>
