<p>This is an (admittedly somewhat intentionally random) interactive \ experience based on the Days of Yore album cover art. Hopefully what you, as the explorer, will need to do next at any given moment (which is almost always simply clicking on something) will be apparent, if not always exactly obvious, but if you find yourself stuck, here are some helpful hints: | Keep an eye on your cursor / mouse pointer. Hovering over an element should let you know whether you can (or can't) click or need to wait to be able to interact further, or provide some other clue as to the element's function. (Also, beware a weird edge-case I discovered during the course of development: if you want the cursors to behave as expected, don't leave Adobe Photoshop running while you are using the site.) | Look out for traffic signals flashing in the top right corner of the browser window. A red hand means much the same thing as it does in real life: you'll need to wait for the current animation to conclude before proceeding. | Occasionally, a cluster of white arrows may briefly appear immediately after you click on something: these indicate where you need to focus your attention next. | If you're still at a loss, look for the elements that most recently appeared, or that used to be static and are now animated. That usually means they are waiting for a click. | Since interaction is meant to build in a more-or-less linear fashion, most items that are clickable once are unlikely to be clickable again after they have served their purpose.</p>
